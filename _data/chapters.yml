    There is no such thing as a pure or adulterated food on its own. We have to make it so. Pure food
    comes from pure people, it is a matter of trust and confidence. This book is about how people
    drew the line between pure and adulterated during the pure food crusades of the later 1800s.
    There is (and was) no natural, pre-human distinction that we can simply uncover and enforce; we
    have to decide where to draw it and how to police it. Today’s world is different from that of our
    nineteenth century forbearers in so many ways, but the challenge of policing the difference
    between acceptable and unacceptable practices remains central to daily decisions about the foods
    we eat, how we produce them, and what choices we make when buying them. The legacy of the
    pure food crusades resonates with us to this day, having put a regulatory framework in place that
    still structures our approach to patrolling the border between pure and adulterated.

  title: The Appearance of Being Earnest
  content: >-
    The introduction brings us the story of Alfred Paraf, a dashing Frenchman known upon his 1885
    death as "foremost in the ranks of the world's swindlers." With chemical training from his dye-
    making father in the Alsatian town of Mulhouse, a cache of patented inventions, and, to quote
    the _New York Times_, "the suave address of a gentleman," Paraf's story of trans-Atlantic
    charlatanism—from France to Scotland to New York to San Francisco to Chile—begins the story
    of pure and adulterated foods with reference to trust, deception, and the confusing appearance of
    reality in a new world of manufactured goods.

  title: Surfaces and Interiors
  content: >-
    As the first of two chapters in _Part I: The Culture of Adulteration_, this canvasses the deep history
    of adulteration to set up the debates about character, sincerity, and authenticity that suffused the
    mid-nineteenth century. Distance matters as a way to understand the confusion and mistrust, but
    cultural distances between people were as dramatic as geographical distances between producers
    and consumers of food. The problem of knowing the difference between the surface of a food
    and its interior, "real" identity was shaped in part by the problem of knowing the difference
    between the surface of a person and their true interior character.

  title: Household, Grocer &amp; Trust
  content: >-
    Adulteration is age old, but a multitude of changes in the later nineteenth century gave the
    problems a different public status. New means of food purchasing, particularly a nascent grocers'
    empire, were key in this regard. The urban grocers' market was a front line in the battle against
    adulteration. It was a place of interaction in the network between producers and consumers and a
    space of exchange between the trusted and suspicious. Chapter 2 put its lens on the border
    between the surface and interior of foods. The relevant border of this chapter is the one between
    inside and outside the body at three levels of a Russian nesting doll, that of the body politic, the
    household body of kitchens and homes, and the individual body.

  title: Margarine in a Dairy World
  content: >-
    This chapter examines oleomargarine and butter as the first of three case studies in _Part II: The
    Geography of Adulteration_. It details the ways margarine was the product of a changing
    agricultural landscape. The story of margarine is intricately tied to the history of butter, which
    means it is about cows and the dairy industry. But it is also tied to cows of the nascent
    slaughterhouse world—margarine's beef fat was a byproduct of the packinghouses of Cincinnati
    and Chicago. The chapter thus brings the testimony of farmers, dairymen, meatpackers, and
    grocers to bear as they weighed in on the growing networks of production tying cities to dairy
    lands and the Midwest to the east coast, the south, and to export markets around the Atlantic
    world.

  title: Oil Without Olives and Lard without Hogs
  content: >-
    In a Southern post-bellum economy, the new profession of the seed crusher extracted oil from
    formerly discarded cottons seeds for what they called "the Cinderella of the New South." It was
    the neglected stepchild now shining for its economic potential. That potential first came as a
    substitute for olive oil, where southern crushers brokered deals with Italian olive growers, who
    then mixed it with their product and sent "pure" olive oil back to the ports of New York. The
    cottonseed crushers also developed supply networks with meatpackers in Chicago, who used it as
    a lard substitute. This chapter draws the geography of the upstart adulterant by mapping the new
    relationships between southern cotton fields, Midwestern packinghouses, and global markets.

  title: Glucose in the Empire of Sugar
  content: >-
    The saga of "Professor" Henry Friend's Electric Sugar Refining Company angered investors and
    bemused readers in the 1880s. Friend was a swindler. He sold sweetener made from starches in a
    process that he never explained to his investors, claiming secrecy, an Edisonian connection, and
    fear of theft. After his scam was exposed in 1889, newspapers raced to compare it to those of the
    wily Alfred Paraf. Producers would call the product "glucose" at a time before the term referred
    to a monosaccharide known as blood sugar. This chapter uses Friend's con as an entry to map the
    geography of fake sugar and sweetener production, tracking their production, distribution and
    status in the landscape of adulteration.

  title: Analysis as Border Patrol
  content: >-
    This is first of two chapters of _Part III: The Analysis of Adulteration_. It puts the focus of pure
    food debates on the chemists, analysts, and other public health officials who responded to the
    proliferation of suspected adulteration. Chemists and public health analysts responded to
    changing agricultural patterns and commercial endeavors in articles, ads, and exposés in journals
    and trade papers, grocer’s publications, and domestic science magazines. The chapter looks to
    the regional and household scales to place the ambitions of chemical analysts into a world of
    domestic chemistry and everyday life, the world where housewives, families, chemists, and
    government officials sought to police the legitimacy of food purchases, preparation, and eating in
    a time of adulteration fears.

  title: Food and the Government Chemist
  content: >-
    Where Chapter 7 takes the regional and household scales at its focus, this one telescopes out to a
    broader political level to attend to commercial-level chemistry. It brings the main narrative to a
    close in the early 1900s, when federal-level authority of scientific analysis and quantitative
    measures of food followed from assumptions about food health, purity, and adulteration of the
    prior half century. Here we get Upton Sinclair, the ultimate passage of a pure food bill, and the
    bureaucratic and institutional success of the Progressive Era in the establishment of the eventual
    FDA. The chapter folds the federal efforts together with the new consumer world of grocers,
    agricultural fields, and foods. By 1906, what mattered was not a food's environmental cultivation
    (a process embodied by agrarian labor) but the fidelity of the chemically detected items on a
    label to the item inside (a product-based assessment). Purity had become a scientific concept.

  title: The Persistence of Adulteration
  content: >-
    Conditions change, adulteration remains. It was a problem in the past, it is a problem today, and
    it will be a problem of public concern tomorrow. This is mainly because our terms for what
    counts as "pure" change with political and cultural conditions, as do our techniques for patrolling
    the border between a purity and adulteration. More important for a healthier future is to engage
    with the environmental process of agriculture and food production, to create ways of broadening
    the experience of food beyond consumer metrics alone, and to build attention to culinary,
    ecological, and other ethical factors in our debates about organic principles, genetic
    modification, additives, and synthetic chemical processing.
