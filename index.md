This is the digital map companion to **_Pure Adulteration: Cheating on Nature in the Age of Manufactured Food_** (University of Chicago Press, 2019).
The book is set between the dawn of manufactured food in the mid-1800s and
the onset of modern food policy in the early 1900s, a period in food and
agricultural history known, among other things, as the Era of Adulteration.
It was a period of enormous environmental upheaval in many notable ways.
Environmental and cultural historians commonly point to rural-urban shifts,
expansion, colonization, imperialism, the birth of national parks, and a
nascent conservationist ethos to frame those changes. But one of the more
remarkable transitions was taking place in agricultural environments.
Conventional agricultural production and food identity were radically upended
in just a half century with new factory systems, new manufactured products,
and new ways of buying, cooking and, ultimately, knowing food. What is more,
those changes grew amidst a rampant concern for character grounded in sincerity
and authenticity in response to the perceived instability of a changing world.
_Pure Adulteration_ uses debates about purity and adulteration—debased, corrupted,
or contaminated food—to examine how the new manufacturing practices challenged
cultural ideas of “nature” and “natural” and how those challenges resulted in
new science-based food regulation. It finds those debates as the outcome of
cultural angst over sincerity, authenticity, honesty, and trust intertwined
with environmental concerns about nature, purity, and health and all invested
in understanding a newly complex food system.

The maps at this companion site help illustrate the changing circumstances
of late-nineteenth century food systems. They begin with a tour of one of the
century’s most notorious con men, [the Chevalier Alfred Paraf](/maps/paraf).
They then provide visual access to [changes in legislation](/maps/margarine-legislation),
commodity production for [oleomargarine](/maps/margarine-production) and
[cottonseed oil](/maps/cottonseed-production), and export patterns for three
contentious adulterants of the era, [oleomargarine](/maps/margarine-exports)
(and [oleo oil](/maps/oil-exports)), [cottonseed oil](/maps/cottonseed-exports),
and [glucose ("grape-sugar")](/maps/glucose-exports). [The Table of Contents](/chapters)
provides further summaries of each chapter of the book and links to
relevant supporting maps. [A Notes page](/notes) provides references to
original GIS map production and the data used to build those maps.
