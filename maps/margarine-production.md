These maps show the growth of butter production on a state-by-state
basis from 1870 to 1900. Beginning in 1880, they also show the
proliferation of oleomargarine production facilities.

Playing the maps in sequence shows a subtle but visible shift in
the dominant dairy states. In mid-century, the Northeast and
upstate New York in particular were leaders in butter production.
As settlement expanded across the continent, so too did butter
production, shifting from the east of the Great Lakes to the west.
Lake lands in particular were crucial for dairy production, because
reliable water supplies kept grass and pasturelands flourishing
for cows so that farmers could produce quality butter from their
milk. After 1870, margarine factories sprouted first on the east
coast (a consequence of Parafâ€™s early escapades) but became more
prominent in the meatpacking Midwest by the turn of the century.
