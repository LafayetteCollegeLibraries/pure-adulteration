These maps show the growth in exports of raw oleo oil from the
United States to other regions in the world from 1890 to 1910. The
government distinguished these exports from finished oleomargarine
(see this page), which producers also shipped by the thousands of
tons to foreign markets.

For oleo oil, the trade grew from three export ports in 1890 (Boston,
New York, and Detroit) to nine in 1910 and from six main global
regional destinations to eight. This was an increase from about 168
million pounds in the 1890s to nearly one billion (973 million) pounds
by 1910. The great majority of foreign shipments went to The
Netherlands, where Jurgens and Lever worked as a joint Anglo-Dutch
company to lead global margarine markets. Germany and the U.K.
remained as second and third place destinations through the period
from 1890 to 1910. As with shipments of finished margarine, notable
trends include a change in destination into the first decade of the
twentieth century to include expanding markets in Asia, Central
America, South America, and Africa.

1. Because trade records provide a wide range of quantities per year,
   for the sake of reader legibility the maps represent proportions.
   For example, an arrow five-hatch-marks wide is five orders of
   magnitude greater than an arrow with one hatch mark, while the
   width of the five-hatch arrow is five times the width of the
   one-hatch arrow. Readers can thus view the maps to gain a sense
   of growth in export markets, relative quantities to various
   parts of the world, and sense of scale in the global
   marketplace for supposed adulterants.

2. The maps derive from government trade statistics that listed departure
   ports (export locations) and final destinations (import
   locations), but not together. For instance, while we know
   manufacturers shipped x pounds of raw oleo oil from New York in 1890,
   we do not know where, specifically, that specific quantity ended
   up. Therefore, the maps show the commodities shipped from
   individual U.S. ports to meet in the Atlantic before dispersing
   to final destinations.

3. In general, government statistics used to construct theses maps
   documented foreign imports by country. Thus, in creating these
   maps the countries were aggregated into regions such as Northern
   Europe, Southern Europe, South America, Central America, Africa,
   and Asia. On the export side, various cities were aggregated
   into regions based on geographical proximity. The full data sets
   show specific nations.
