These maps show trends in the export flow of glucose from United
States ports to the world from 1890 to 1910. Exporters shipped
glucose (or “grape-sugar”) by the tens of millions of pounds
throughout the later 1800s. The trade grew from three export ports
in 1890 (Boston, New York, and Detroit) to six in 1910; it
expanded from five global regional destinations to seven. In terms
of quantity, the exports grew fifteen-fold from about 46 million
to 728 million pounds in 1910. Some of the more notable trends are
the increases in shipment to various South American countries by
the early 1900s and shipments to new Asian markets beginning in
1905. The United Kingdom was such a large trading partner with
the U.S. for glucose that their records offered more precision
and, thus, the maps show direct flows to the UK while showing
aggregated export streams to regions (Northern Europe, Southern
Europe, South America) with less specificity in record keeping.
Full data sets of export and import locations listing individual
nations and quantities are [here](/notes).

1. Because trade records provide a wide range of quantities per
   year, for the sake of reader legibility the maps represent
   proportions. For example, an arrow five-hatch-marks wide is
   five orders of magnitude greater than an arrow with one hatch
   mark, while the width of the five-hatch arrow is five times
   the width of the one-hatch arrow. Readers can thus view the
   maps to gain a sense of growth in export markets, relative
   quantities to various parts of the world, and sense of scale
   in the global marketplace for supposed adulterants.

2. The maps derive from government trade statistics that listed
   departure ports (export locations) and final destinations
   (import locations), but not together. For instance, while we know
   manufacturers shipped x pounds of glucose from New York in 1890,
   we do not know where, specifically, that specific quantity ended
   up. Therefore, the maps show the commodities shipped from
   individual U.S. ports to meet in the Atlantic before dispersing
   to final destinations.

3. In general, but not consistently, the government statistics used
   to construct theses maps documented foreign imports by country.
   Thus, in creating these maps the countries were aggregated into
   regions such as Northern Europe, Southern Europe, South America,
   Central America, Africa, and Asia. On the export side, various
   cities were aggregated into regions based on geographical
   proximity. The full data sets show specific nations.
