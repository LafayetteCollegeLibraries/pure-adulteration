These maps show the growth in exports of finished oleomargarine
from the United States to other regions in the world from 1890
to 1910. The government distinguished these exports from raw oleo
oil (see this page), which producers also shipped by the thousands
of tons to foreign markets.

For margarine, the trade grew from five export ports in 1890 (Boston,
New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, and New Orleans) to six in 1910
and from five main global regional destinations to eight. This was
an increase from about 6 million pounds to 26 million pounds by the
first decade of the twentieth century. Most of those foreign
shipments first went to British colonial holdings in the West Indies,
before being displaced in priority by shipments to Germany, Norway,
and The Netherlands by the early twentieth century. As with shipments
of raw oleo oil, notable trends include a change in destination
into the early 1900s to include expanding markets in Asia, Central
America, South America, and Africa. Full data sets of the flow paths
listing individual nations and quantities are [here](/notes).

1. Because trade records provide a wide range of quantities per year,
   for the sake of reader legibility the maps represent proportions.
   For example, an arrow five-hatch-marks wide is five orders of
   magnitude greater than an arrow with one hatch mark, while the
   width of the five-hatch arrow is five times the width of the
   one-hatch arrow. Readers can thus view the maps to gain a sense
   of growth in export markets, relative quantities to various parts
   of the world, and sense of scale in the global marketplace for
   supposed adulterants.

2. The maps derive from government trade statistics that listed
   departure ports (export locations) and final destinations (import
   locations), but not together. For instance, while we know
   manufacturers shipped x pounds of raw oleo oil from New York
   in 1890, we do not know where, specifically, that specific
   quantity ended up. Therefore, the maps show the commodities
   shipped from individual U.S. ports to meet in the Atlantic before
   dispersing to final destinations.

3. In general, government statistics used to construct theses maps
   documented foreign imports by country. Thus, in creating these
   maps the countries were aggregated into regions such as Northern
   Europe, Southern Europe, South America, Central America, Africa,
   and Asia. On the export side, various cities were aggregated into
   regions based on geographical proximity. The full data sets show
   specific nations.
