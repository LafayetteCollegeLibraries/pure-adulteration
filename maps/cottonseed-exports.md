These maps show the export flow of cottonseed oil from U.S. ports
to the world from 1880 to 1900. Overall, the trade grew from two
export cities in 1880 (New York and New Orleans) to nine in 1900
and from six global regional destinations to nine. That was an
increase from 8 million to over 260 million pounds. The largest
export stream went to Southern Europe across all twenty years
(principally Italy and southern France). By 1900, northern
European nations (The Netherlands, Belgium, and the UK) played
a bigger part in the trade. Note that trade records show the
British holding of Gibraltar in 1880 and 1890, but then
directly to the UK in 1900.

The width of the arrows represents the quantity of oil from tens
of thousands to hundreds of millions of pounds. Because the
specific locations (export locations) from trade records were too
numerous to include with individual arrows, the maps show regional
flows rather than specific national ones. Also note that
inconsistency in record keeping leads to inconsistent labels for
the export locations. Thus, some are continents, some are regions,
and some are nations. We have sought to provide as much consistency
as possible across the range of maps.

1. Because trade records provide a wide range of quantities per year,
   for the sake of reader legibility the maps represent proportions.
   For example, an arrow five-hatch-marks wide is five orders of
   magnitude greater than an arrow with one hatch mark, while the width
   of the five-hatch arrow is five times the width of the one-hatch
   arrow. Readers can thus view the maps to gain a sense of growth in
   export markets, relative quantities to various parts of the world,
   and sense of scale in the global marketplace for supposed adulterants.

2. The maps derive from government trade statistics that listed departure
   ports (export locations) and final destinations (import locations),
   but not together. For instance, while we know manufacturers shipped
   x pounds of cottonseed oil from New York in 1890, we do not know where,
   specifically, that specific quantity ended up. Therefore, the maps show
   the commodities shipped from each individual American port to meet in
   the middle of the Atlantic before dispersing to final destinations.

3. The government statistics used to generate these maps documented
   foreign imports by country. Thus, in creating the maps the
   countries were aggregated into regions such as Northern Europe,
   Southern Europe, South America, Central America, Africa, and Asia.
   On the export side, various cities were aggregated into regions
   based on geographical proximity.
