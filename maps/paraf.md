This is the Paraf Itinerary. Chapter 1 of the book includes
the story of the Chevalier Alfred Paraf. He was a chemist and
con man who travelled from his 1844 birthplace in Mulhouse, near
the Rhine River in present-day France, to the United States,
then across North America, and finally to South America where
he died in 1885. The sixteen-step itinerary here follows his
path with snapshots of his main stopping points. The travelogue
maps his efforts, investments, patents, scams, and accrual of
foes.
